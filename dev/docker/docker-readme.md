# RDPGW
## What is RDPGW?
Remote Desktop Gateway (RDPGW, RDG or RD Gateway) provides a secure encrypted connection 
to user desktops via RDP. It enhances control by removing all remote user direct access to 
your system and replaces it with a point-to-point remote desktop connection.

## How to use this image
The remote desktop gateway relies on an OpenID Connect authentication service, such as Keycloak, 
Azure AD or Google, and a backend remote desktop service such as XRDP, gnome-remote-desktop, or
Windows VMs. Make sure that these services have been properly setup and can be reached from
where you will run this image. 

This image works stateless, which means it does not store any state by default. In case you configure
the session store to be a `filestore` a little bit of session information is stored temporarily. This means
that a load balancer would need to maintain state for a while, which typically is the case.

Session and token encryption keys will be randomized on startup. As a consequence sessions will be
invalidated on restarts and if you are load balancing the different instances will not be able to share
user sessions. Make sure to set these encryption keys to something static, so they can be shared 
across the different instances if this is not what you want.
